# Accountant Program for #2205~

This program is to save me from being the accountant of our apartment...  

## Tutorial

* DON'T follow your instinct... If the program crushes, I won't be responsible :)  
* To delete someone you accidentally added in the participants (or just misspelled), type that wrong name again and 
  click `DELETE`.  
* The default buyer on the second page will be the ones from your last entry, if any.  
* Add-stuff page supports simple multiplication in the form of ***float*** \* ***positive_float***, which is the only
  form that makes sense to me... You can use `*`, `x` or `X` for multiplication.
* If you entered a wrong item (or wrong price anyway), delete it by adding its negative price. We don't delete things 
  here...

## (Unimportant) Tips

Instead of clicking buttons you can  

* Use `Enter` to enter input  
* Use `Shift + Enter` to proceed to the next page  

There's nothing for `DELETE` :) you take care of your own typos
