# Accountant Program for #2205~

This program is to save me from being the accountant of our apartment...  

### Tutorial

* DON'T follow your instinct... If the program crushes, I won't be responsible :)  
* To delete someone you accidentally added in the participants (or just misspelled), type that wrong name again and 
  click `DELETE`.  
* The default buyer on the second page will be the ones from your last entry, if any.  
* Add-stuff page supports arithmetic expressions input.
* If you entered a wrong item (or wrong price anyway), delete it by adding its negative price. Haven't implemented 
  delete yet...

### (Unimportant) Tips

Instead of clicking buttons you can  

* Use `Enter` to enter input  
* Use `Shift + Enter` to proceed to the next page  

## TODO

Someone helps me with GUI maybe...? The background color is so ugly...
